hey everybody SimpliSafe has a camera you can control from your phone and it's great but they also want to protect your home and your privacy so they came up with this great idea a privacy shutter for their camera they got to work started testing different Metals in hinge designs for months and months and the result was an effective home security camera with a thin lightweight aluminum privacy shutter and it said that kind of attention to detail it sets SimpliSafe apart keep your family safe learn more about SimpliSafe today at simplisafe.com stuff that's simpli safe.com stuff hey everybody it's your old pal Josh and for this week's sys K select I've chosen how the hum Works came out back in December of 2014 and it is probably the saddest most aggravating Affliction I can think of next to Morgan's because people don't believe you when you have this thing it's pretty interesting episode if you ask me it's got everything The X-Files makes an appearance and so does vocal fry before a vocal fry episode ever came out so hope you enjoy it pawn shops welcome to stuff you should know from how stuff works.com  hey I'm walking to the podcast on Josh Clark for Charles W Chuck Bryant and I would say it's stuff you should know but it's not because I haven't said Jerry and now I did so this is stuff you should know  are people going crazy yet but I don't know there's probably some people he started going crazy the moment they hit play Chuck's version of the hum capital T Capital H yeah so the home you just did  it makes sense it to him but apparently like if you'd listen I don't know I wonder if you can do the same thing I'm hearing because you're hearing it in your head but there's like a Gravely quality to it the vocal fry okay if you want to call it that I say Gravely but it's not it wasn't constant The Gravely can give it texture and it was kind of broken up a little bit that is more then the The Unbroken part that was going through out yeah so apparently while this is called the hum and we should eventually explain what we're talking about it's not the classical definition of a hum that people here right it's not it's it's it's like a diesel truck idling engine idling issues with a classic description of a vocal fry is one of those you ever hear and learn of a new expression or thing in the never heard of and then you see everywhere it's called the baader-meinhof phenomenon and it's happening to me with vocal fry where did you hear that  I can't remember where they initially heard it but it's a thing now that they say like Kim Kardashian is who they always blame it's in the vocal affectation that supposedly young women are using now where they go into that lower tone that Gravelly tone uncertain at fight the ends of sentences you being promoted at work or something yeah it is the female equivalent of the guys who speak up yeah we're all the old valley girl thing of the witches of speak like the valley girls talking like that but now it's you know he was a nice guy but I really wasn't sure what his motivation was okay yeah that's great the pigtails is now yeah I was talking to me about it the other day she was like do I do that so now you don't do that no you don't I just did that didn't i l a little bit but you you were doing a different voice so it makes sense yeah  anyway I can't escape it now it's like every other day since I've heard it I've seen something about vocal fry people with vocal fry more all the time okay yeah it's annoying like what you're describing has really nothing to do with the hump but it actually does have a lot in common with the home in that it's driving me to Suicide tend to be able to focus in on it more and more easily the more that they're exposed to it which is the opposite of what should happen to it a noise that really is inconsequential in the environment that's right so what were talking about your Chuck is the hump with a capital H that's right what what is it well it is it is it sound mysterious sound that is heard in places around the world by about 2% of the five local population it is a low freaking we're going to get into the frequencies  that but let's just got a low-frequency rumbling right now it's a drone it's a vibration describe sometimes as it sounds like it's coming from nowhere or inside my own head and it is there are places all around the world where like I said very small population of people experience this hum and depending on where you are they will name at that time like the Auckland home the Windsor hum the Bristol home via the Taos hum and it's been described you know going back to the 1800's people have talked about it and literature but really in the 1950 60s and 70s in the modern world is when people have started describing hearing this thing that drives them batty basically one of the ways that it drives and baddies Bill say Do you hear that and everyone else in the room will say no the other 98% of people say  what else in the room goes right maybe a little wacky this General late night it's worse at night for sure and generally and more rural areas yes which makes sense because it's not as much noise pollution I think exactly it also is tends to be worse in doors so at night which is a weird indoors means that you don't get much sleep because it's something that you can't not focus on people who suffer from the hum 10 to say that it dominates the soundscape yeah it's not something they can just tune out right it's not something that they're getting used to and again the more the more they're exposed to it the easier they say it is to tune into it I guess become cognizant of it yet again yeah that's about it yeah and imagine being played by a sound that does this to you and that everyone else says is not real because they don't hear it yeah and it it's been I mean we'll get into the reasons  are there maybe or may not be happening but it's been pass off as mass hysteria Mass delusion from everything from Matt to like government conspiracy to legitimate illegitimate noise whether or not it's acoustic or electromagnetic and that's part of the problem is is there one hum weather lots of homes is there no harm you know your ears Skeptics will say there is no harm its tinnitus or it's something like that right or some other inner ear annoys like Odell acoustic noise so who knows that the hum okay so again let's let's restate this and let's put ourselves in the position of the outsider okay cuz I don't experience them so I don't either knock on wood because the more I research it some more I'm like oh God I hope I never do we we left out one  quality of it that is that is common around the world and when we say around the world it tends to be curiously concentrated in the West End in Euro Euro ancestry West yeah I didn't really see anything about any countries in the East if you look at there is a guy who runs a little in McPherson yes Clan MacPherson run something called the world hum map and database and we ran into Glen McPherson before we get too far we should give a huge shout-out to Jerry Keller over at Mike who wrote this amazing article called The Mysterious sound is driving people insane and nobody knows what's causing it totally worth Reading PA and he talks about a guy named Glenn McPherson who's the professor in British Columbia and he set up a website called the world hum map in database and so anybody who hears the hump can go and fill out a questionnaire and then it takes that  and put the dot on the map you can hover over the. And get the day that right if you look at it it's just the United States Great Britain Western Europe South Africa's pretty it's it's unusual that there's nothing in Africa except South Africa and it's just in these European ancestry Western countries on the one hand you could say well that's because this is an english-language database and I have no idea what I'm typing here but yeah yeah exactly exclamation exclamations to and now we arrive at one of them we're going back on the outside because you don't hear the hump I don't hear the hump and let's say that where your nose and throat guys and somebody comes to us and says I'm going crazy like I'm seriously contemplating suicide because this home is keeping me up at night I haven't slept at  hey I'm irritable I have headaches nosebleeds I'm nauseated all the time these are all common symptoms of Home suffers you're going to think one of two things is a a doctor a physician one is tinnitus you're crazy you're driving yourself crazy both of them can kind of be explained away and they are explained by this guy named David Deming and he is a geoscientist from the University of Oklahoma and he wrote what is probably the definitive study on the hum so far back in 2004 that's right so dimming apparently if you look at his research there is another theory and this is where the US government comes into play because there's a couple of  there's a couple of theories revolving around the US Military and whether or not they are causing this one is with their high frequency active auroral research program H AARP in Alaska and they truly transmit RF signals into the ionosphere and very well we should we go and start talking about the frequency ranges v o f n e l f a v o f is very low frequency and those are waves at one hurts and the other one is he left right  was there a extremely low frequencies in there in the range of the same amount of hurts but their wavelength is up to like a hundred thousand right extremely long wavelength that's right and people who think you know they call them hum investigators they believe pretty much that it is a vlf in dlf tones that are driving these people crazy and those tones can drive you crazy are they do have adverse effects on the body you know you you probably heard about a lot and when it comes to like cell phone radiation nothing but whether or not he lfn vlf is or are the hum is what's a matter of much debate it is a matter of debate because and it's also kind of a matter of faith  because what you're talking about there with ALS and BLS frequencies is a tones those are radio waves and radio is part of the electromagnetic spectrum Spectrum right yeah so it has been shown a very very high frequencies humans can detect electromagnetic sound we take it as sound here which is weird cuz it's not supposed to happen like that but that's how we experience it it's not like at a high frequency we suddenly see it we hear it and if you are familiar with the comet 67p that the European Space Agency recently landed on just crazy that comment was found to admit a an electromagnetic clicking sound which is how we experience electromagnets are electromagnetic sound at a certain frequency and so because it's a clicking sound it's not a home at all some people are saying that doesn't make any  this is a Hammett doesn't if we can hear it it's it's it doesn't sound like a and idling diesel engine it sounds like a clicking sound or something like that and then what's more what this is saying is that if it's a very low frequency or extremely low frequency that's the opposite of how we hear electromagnetic radiation we hired a very high frequency not a very low frequency so what which one is it so yes it's still a huge matter of debate even as to whether the hum first of all if it does exist yeah if it's a single Source single source and then if it is a single Source or any kind of source is it electromagnetic or is it acoustic right and will impact the difference between those things right after this  Shut Up Fisher  let's talk about SimpliSafe showy yes they are at home security camera and they are at home security system but actually care about your home and your privacy so they obsess over details and you can tell from the design and how user-friendly their stuff is but they also care about you their customer so they figured out a way to make their camera the security camera in your house private and you can control from your app you can also control the privacy settings and it physically shut the shutter on the camera and it makes a little click sound so you know it's closed and they wanted to have a light on it so you could easily tell when it's on so if you're walking around your home naked as a blue bird you don't have to worry about weirdos eavesdropping on you visually that's right it simply safe is it just home security it's home security done right and right now you can check out Simply Safe today at simplisafe.com stuff that's s i m p l i  safe.com stuff  so as to whether or not the hum exist the Canadian government actually part of the problem is it's hard to get research done on this because very small number of people experience it and a lot of them are called crackpots so it's tough to get funding for research but luckily there's a country called Canada that will fun things like this and dr. Colin Novak spent a year listening to The Windsor hum in Ontario and what they found was the hum is real and they trace the source in that case to on the Michigan side of the Detroit River Raceway steel plant on Zug Island and supposedly generates a lot of dlf waves when they're operating so in this instance at least the home was a real thing and they found out it was a tone created from Bass clean industrial plant  they apparently took steps to cut down on whatever energy I was admitting and they turn off the machine and all of a sudden some people said that worked a lot of people said that did absolutely nothing but I'm still out there and then the most people said I still don't know what you're talking about so that actually the first time government has looked into the hum in Taos New Mexico there's something called the Taos hum and apparently somebody wrote in to complain about it to a local newspaper and all the sudden like hundreds more people said yes I hear the same thing I've been hearing the same thing for years what is going on and enough is enough people said something in New Mexico that it prompted an investigation by the University of New Mexico and Sandia Labs which I think it's like a government Affiliated kind of oil it sit a neat research lab that you all sorts of cool clandestine stuff nitrite  very much that was mention the hum episode called Drive yeah they talk about it there is a a couple of characters had to constantly move Westward or else they would suffer from the pressure of the home that no one else could hear let me guess Mulder believe Scully did not exactly how did you sell that one but you know so awesome and they could never figure out what it was so I think they kind of wrote it off as either Mass delusion or bunch of people had tinnitus or what-have-you which is again that's the that's the easy that's the easy answer like you have tinnitus the problem is if it's if a person has tinnitus they the sound is internal like remember there's like a bee idea that the get a high-pitch ringing yes usually it can become very in in in Pitch right but for the most part it's in its you can tell it's internal with the hump everyone  who experiences the hum says no this is external and it's it's there so convinced as external that they'll go out at night when it's worse and try to find the source of it will drive around their city or their neighborhood or walk around and look for what it is it's driving him crazy and they'll never find it turn off the power to their house or I mean there's all sorts of extreme and of course it's all like a anecdotal but people that are driven to Suicide are this one guy who intentionally deaf and himself with a chainsaw and possibly even murder which will get to in a bit interesting but the point is that it's not just something that's just bugging people like it is having the hump their people all over the world that don't know each other that have never met that are suffering from something that they  there's that other people can't hear in concentrated areas affecting the quality of life and I don't know if I ever finish the sentence which is weird that means I'm really interested in something okay but did we say you're did I say that people who suffer from the hump him to be in their 50s and older that's one of the markers between 50 and 7 okay so there's a this is something in the favor of acoustic sound so Acoustic sound does a compression wave and it's something that carried through and propagates through media so there is a vibration in the air where is an electromagnetic wave comes from an electrical or a magnetic or both Source yeah this is like the vibe vibration it's a sound wave it's it's an acoustic wave right right so as we age so you get to around 50 years of age you your ability to hear  frequency and mid-frequency Acoustic sound diminishes your low-frequency capabilities go undiminished so it's not like they increase but comparatively speaking right and you get better hearing low frequencies around age 50 interesting so what some people think is that if it is electromagnetic then there are some people out there who are capable of hearing electromagnetic waves while the rest of us can't and they're being driven Crazy by some source that we have yet to identify or if it's acoustic that there are some people out there who are superheroes of low frequency sound which would also kind of do away with another diagnosis that a lot of doctors give people which is hyperacusis which to me is worth a whole other podcast with another people kill themselves over yeah his height and Hyper hearing  Lowe's is unbearable thing is is if you have hyperacusis it's not just going to be some home that you here and everything else is normal which is what Humsafar his experience you would hear everything on this Grand scale you be like Spider-Man exactly who are predisposed to hearing low frequency sounds way better than other people and that it comes as their higher and mid-frequency capabilities diminish with age right but again what are they hearing well that's right I mention earlier that h a a r p program that the u.s. government military is doing Alaska the other one that I teased is the takamo the take charge and move out system on the 1960s u.s. Navy basically adopted this program to be able to communicate with submarines long-range bombers ballistic missiles during nuclear war and  use very low frequency radio waves to do so and you know it's a real thing but is it the hum other conspiracy theorist will say that the US government is also using these things to Target individuals and of course that's you know you want to say that's probably bunk but you never know is that if the home is electromagnetic in nature tinfoil hat and aluminum foil hat would actually work is it blocks out about a thin layer of aluminum can block out like 98% of electromagnetic waves so that's pretty ironic that it might actually  although I don't I haven't heard whether that helps people with the hum if they put on that would help or not her fast if you read David demings Journal article it's called the hump and anomalous sound heard round the world and there is a journal called the Journal of scientific exploration which is a peer-reviewed scientific journal that accepts articles on things on The Fringe of science sure which the most decidedly is David demmin Gets In to talk about when you basically says this is a secret government program so obviously we can't get any real answers we don't know how often it works or how often they're transmitting or anything but we do know it is a real thing and he correlate some dates when there's like upgrades to the system and then all the sudden this one area around the same time there's the Kokomo Indiana hum starts right so he he does a good job of correlating it and I think that's kind of what he settled  he believes that is probably the taco program that this very low frequency transmission to submarines underwater from airplanes above is being propagated around the world and that would suggest that it's a global Source right that it's just some people can hear these radio waves that you're not supposed to be able to hear ya or its multiple sources combined like a combined effect like if you live near an industrial plant that has a machine that's riding the sound that may be certain people return to or not it's another characteristic is that it's mostly experienced in the country  cuz he had just chalk that up to noise pollution being revised like when I worked at a convenience store in the midnight shift the when I work during the day I was I would not notice anything but when I worked there at night at 3 a.m. that would hear the buzzing of the fluorescent lights and it would drive me crazy you know I would turn them off and people think we're closed so the thing is you eventually stopped hearing that right when I left work that's called habituation so habituation means that you are capable of so like you'd focus on these things the whole time you were there well yeah in the middle of that wouldn't focus on it but I would notice I'd be reading a book and I would just hear that  ultrasound but I never noticed it during the day when the lights are on when you didn't hear it that's habituation we're like you're exposed to something your brain says this is totally it's not a threat I don't have to pay attention to it anymore so anytime in this context that I hear that sound I don't have to become cognizant of it no apparently you did you kind of like fell into cognizance like here there in like you'd notice it again but if for a normal human being when you're exposed to something like that over and over again the less you notice it right but like we said with the hum the more you're exposed to the easier it is to TuneIn yeah and what that's called Escape it and no and not only can you not Escape it you can catch it easier and easier like you can become cognizant of it easier and easier the more you're exposed to it that's called sensitization where  I guess another explanation for the the suffers of the hump they are hearing something one of the reasons that it drives him so bad he is because their habituation levels are low but they're sensitive sensitive Asian levels are high right so they're not able to ignore it and some part of their brain is working in on it and this creates this I guess a perfect storm of hellacious mess  alright well right after this break I did mention murder so we're going to talk about one of the more interesting parts of the effects of the hump right after this  hey everybody stuff you should know is brought to you by our Pals at Rocket mortgage by Quicken Loans it's right when it comes to your work or at least I hope so your hobbies your life rocket mortgage wants to make

Equal Housing lender license in all 50 states nmls consumer access. Org number 3 0 3 0  alright so I mentioned murder like I said and one of the things that what is the guy's name Steve Cold glaze he's a mechanical engineer and hum investigator in Connecticut and I believe he was the one that traced The Windsor hum to Zug Island and he has done some research that he believes the hum and others believe the hum could be responsible for  well for killing other people specifically in his case he actually approach Connecticut State Police investigators after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Newtown Connecticut and he said the eye from a nearby gas pipeline might have driven Adam Lanza too well have contributed to driving him to do something like this and I don't think he's saying this made him crazy so he did this I think he's saying the fragile minded people could be pushed over the edge of could be the last straw for somebody and I don't know how much green to ask but investigators did at least include that in the documents they released to the public so they thought it was worthy enough to put in the enemy 7,000 other documents released to the public and he's not the only one I remember the Navy Yard shooting in 2013 Aaron Alexis  he fully came out and said quote ultra low frequency attack is what I've been subject to for the last 3 years I'm sorry 3 months and to be perfectly honest that is what has driven me to this in quote and he scrawled and scratched e l f on the shotgun barrel that he used to kill 12 people at the Washington Navy yard and he scratched my elf weapon on the stock I think yeah and basically conspiracy theorist what's a while this is clearly driving people to do things like this Skeptics are going to say now these people are delusional and they're the ones who believe the government is shooting them with these POF tones and driving them crazy but either way it's a little startling  did someone win scratch that in their shotgun before they did something like that and then blame it on that out right but you know how exposed was he to those conspiracy theories like a lot of times I would say well do you know there's a Yahoo group dedicated to the home there's that one world hum map and database in like people who go see these things I mean are they are they just suggestible and they're like yeah I can hear it to David Deming points out like that's crazy that idea that people are tuning into this thing that's having a really diminishing effect on their well-being as part of just a mass delusion or something like that kind of goes against the the typical psychology of master illusion where people join crowds to be added to get some sort of positive benefit or effect from it right there feeling a sense of inclusion or whatever by saying I hear the hum to been in a very small minority but apparently if you are  Humsafar like your life is screwed up and you're not a happy person yeah I will say this one thing I've noticed about conspiracy theorist is none of them ever believe one thing. They believe a lot of them you know so that's all I have to say about that not only is this driving people crazy there is evidence that if this does exist if there is something that if there's some sort of what's called low frequency noise that's in the environment it is it's everywhere but if people are being exposed to it there's evidence that biologically speaking it can have an impact sure and they're just happened to be this incredible real world laboratory that spring up in Portugal in the late 70s because a guy named castelo Branco was put in charge of the Portuguese Air Force's maintenance repair and Manufacturing  plant called oh, I don't know Portuguese accent or else I do it happened it just be sitting there and he watched a aircraft technician wander around aimlessly in what apparently looked a lot like an epileptic seizure to this doctor and that it was during an it was called an aircraft run up procedure where they like going through all the systems and this guy was just standing there and all of a sudden he's wandering around so he looked into it and found that 10% of the workers at this aircraft repair shop or diagnosed with the late onset epilepsy and if you looked at the population in compared to the population of Portugal large not you wouldn't expect 10% to have it you'd expect to percentile while to have it now the fact that there are a lot of people who are being diagnosed with this really do believe that they were  exposed to this low frequency noise at everybody was having it a dangerous effect on them and this one guy who is a worker there. Really interested in all this and he created a living will his name was Philippe Pedro in Philippe Pedro is like you cut me open the moment I die and do an autopsy and they found this guy was messed up like how like his that his aorta his heart was thick and the walls were thicken inexplicably Fried Chicken yet pretty much yeah but no that would be explicable so he was a very healthy person then is what you're apparently what they found doesn't jive with his lifestyle he was he was diagnosed with late onset epilepsy he died at age 58 he had to thicken he had taken heart tissue he had a tumor in his kidney had a tumor in his liver and apparently now thanks to this guy and his autopsy he kind of like laid the groundwork for this investigation into  frequency noise being dangerous for humans even though we don't feel anything but on a cellular level being exposed to the stuff has these effects so apparently if you have thickening of your heart tissue without any kind of inflammation response that is a classic sign of low frequency noise damage it's what's called vibroacoustic disease which certain people may be susceptible to and others are not in theory it was supposedly anyone exposed to it would be susceptible to it really is some people might actually be able to hear right okay what they're being exposed to you while while most people might not so we're all exposed to it then yeah in this article I can't remember the name of it but it was it was basically an overview of this this some aircraft  play buy some Portuguese scientists they they said it's almost impossible to get a control group to compare because everybody's exposed to low frequency noise just most of us aren't aware of it yeah it's just everywhere but it's not considered a nuisance except for that two to 11% of 4 people who suffer from hearing right and their accounts differ widely as well so that's it's tough to study and you can't get funding to study because it's fringe science unless you're in Canada so they say turn the fan on at night really make sense if the White Noise app should I sleep there again the awesome article by Jerry Keller yeah life science had a couple good articles and then David Deming  the home in anomalous sound heard around the world and then if this kind of stuff floats your boat you might want to check out some of our friends sites to there's a great podcast by our friend Roman Mars I'm 99% invisible yeah who would be able to explain a lot of the science behind this kind of thing um no but it's kind of up his alley like the vibroacoustic chardia I can totally see him getting into that I just think if somebody dug that they dig 99percentinvisible agreed definitely have probably had something about the right yeah I found molar and of course you can hang out at how stuff works you can just type the home in I don't think it'll bring up an article but see what happens if we don't have one yet but yeah type home into the search bar and see what comes up it's just a fun game since I said search bar it's time for listener mail  I need to call this Limousin Ranch hey guys I finally have a story for you after listing for over 5 years I live in super rural South Dakota not just the regular Ol South Dakota right my town is only about 30 200 people and it is a largest down within a hundred-mile radius the main business here is agriculture and ranching and big surprise after I married my plumber husband from St.Louis we move back to my little Hometown 6 years ago where we started a plumbing business he started playing business shortly after moving here we got a call to go to Anderson's limosin Ranch Limousin ranch with no e on the end after driving out to the country and lots of gravel roads later he came up on the ranch you fail to see any limos he said he couldn't figure out where all the limousines were and why there would be a limousine company dealership in the middle of nowhere on an Indian reservation I guess he ask the owners and they explained that they run Limousin cattle on their Ranch which I looked up its  type of cattle from the limousine region of France they don't look like they're wearing cloaks or anything my brother and I tease them for quite some time on this to get a mental image of the absurdity imagine the bass Prairie of Dances with Wolves are Fargo and then expect to see a limousine dealership out there or just a bunch of limousines is kind of Meandering around a field that sounds like something that would happen in Fargo sure it's very Coen Brothers ask but not Kevin Costner asking no he's pretty self serious yeah he did well yeah back in the day when he was a Bible I watch the preview only for that movie Draft Day that he did recently yeah I can barely make it to the preview preview built it up there like I can't believe he's doing it it's really going to do this and it's about the NFL draft and they finally I was when I was in the movie theater the preview of  number to my buddy Scottie do you know and I was like what like what does he do does he like open fire on the road like shoot people or is it just some sort of trade I can't believe this is happening did you ever see the movie know what was Scott steak on it he just laughed and said yeah exactly that sounds like a guy that's he's the guy that laughs and things like that is from Jennifer Coleman oh I forgot we were and her husband for that that's pretty funny stuff and he should stick to the plumbing business and yeah for real not the limousine company finding business someone you loved on our show you can't we

 hey I'm walking to the podcast on Josh Clark for Charles W Chuck Bryant and I would say it's stuff you should know but it's not because I haven't said Jerry and now I did so this is stuff you should know
 are people going crazy yet but I don't know there's probably some people he started going crazy the moment they hit play Chuck's version of the hum capital T Capital H yeah so the home you just did
 it makes sense it to him but apparently like if you'd listen I don't know I wonder if you can do the same thing I'm hearing because you're hearing it in your head but there's like a Gravely quality to it the vocal fry okay if you want to call it that I say Gravely but it's not it wasn't constant The Gravely can give it texture and it was kind of broken up a little bit that is more then the The Unbroken part that was going through out yeah so apparently while this is called the hum and we should eventually explain what we're talking about it's not the classical definition of a hum that people here right it's not it's it's it's like a diesel truck idling engine idling issues with a classic description of a vocal fry is one of those you ever hear and learn of a new expression or thing in the never heard of and then you see everywhere it's called the baader-meinhof phenomenon and it's happening to me with vocal fry where did you hear that
 I can't remember where they initially heard it but it's a thing now that they say like Kim Kardashian is who they always blame it's in the vocal affectation that supposedly young women are using now where they go into that lower tone that Gravelly tone uncertain at fight the ends of sentences you being promoted at work or something yeah it is the female equivalent of the guys who speak up yeah we're all the old valley girl thing of the witches of speak like the valley girls talking like that but now it's you know he was a nice guy but I really wasn't sure what his motivation was okay yeah that's great the pigtails is now yeah I was talking to me about it the other day she was like do I do that so now you don't do that no you don't I just did that didn't i l a little bit but you you were doing a different voice so it makes sense yeah
 anyway I can't escape it now it's like every other day since I've heard it I've seen something about vocal fry people with vocal fry more all the time okay yeah it's annoying like what you're describing has really nothing to do with the hump but it actually does have a lot in common with the home in that it's driving me to Suicide tend to be able to focus in on it more and more easily the more that they're exposed to it which is the opposite of what should happen to it a noise that really is inconsequential in the environment that's right so what were talking about your Chuck is the hump with a capital H that's right what what is it well it is it is it sound mysterious sound that is heard in places around the world by about 2% of the five local population it is a low freaking we're going to get into the frequencies
 that but let's just got a low-frequency rumbling right now it's a drone it's a vibration describe sometimes as it sounds like it's coming from nowhere or inside my own head and it is there are places all around the world where like I said very small population of people experience this hum and depending on where you are they will name at that time like the Auckland home the Windsor hum the Bristol home via the Taos hum and it's been described you know going back to the 1800's people have talked about it and literature but really in the 1950 60s and 70s in the modern world is when people have started describing hearing this thing that drives them batty basically one of the ways that it drives and baddies Bill say Do you hear that and everyone else in the room will say no the other 98% of people say
 what else in the room goes right maybe a little wacky this General late night it's worse at night for sure and generally and more rural areas yes which makes sense because it's not as much noise pollution I think exactly it also is tends to be worse in doors so at night which is a weird indoors means that you don't get much sleep because it's something that you can't not focus on people who suffer from the hum 10 to say that it dominates the soundscape yeah it's not something they can just tune out right it's not something that they're getting used to and again the more the more they're exposed to it the easier they say it is to tune into it I guess become cognizant of it yet again yeah that's about it yeah and imagine being played by a sound that does this to you and that everyone else says is not real because they don't hear it yeah and it it's been I mean we'll get into the reasons
 are there maybe or may not be happening but it's been pass off as mass hysteria Mass delusion from everything from Matt to like government conspiracy to legitimate illegitimate noise whether or not it's acoustic or electromagnetic and that's part of the problem is is there one hum weather lots of homes is there no harm you know your ears Skeptics will say there is no harm its tinnitus or it's something like that right or some other inner ear annoys like Odell acoustic noise so who knows that the hum okay so again let's let's restate this and let's put ourselves in the position of the outsider okay cuz I don't experience them so I don't either knock on wood because the more I research it some more I'm like oh God I hope I never do we we left out one
 quality of it that is that is common around the world and when we say around the world it tends to be curiously concentrated in the West End in Euro Euro ancestry West yeah I didn't really see anything about any countries in the East if you look at there is a guy who runs a little in McPherson yes Clan MacPherson run something called the world hum map and database and we ran into Glen McPherson before we get too far we should give a huge shout-out to Jerry Keller over at Mike who wrote this amazing article called The Mysterious sound is driving people insane and nobody knows what's causing it totally worth Reading PA and he talks about a guy named Glenn McPherson who's the professor in British Columbia and he set up a website called the world hum map in database and so anybody who hears the hump can go and fill out a questionnaire and then it takes that
 and put the dot on the map you can hover over the. And get the day that right if you look at it it's just the United States Great Britain Western Europe South Africa's pretty it's it's unusual that there's nothing in Africa except South Africa and it's just in these European ancestry Western countries on the one hand you could say well that's because this is an english-language database and I have no idea what I'm typing here but yeah yeah exactly exclamation exclamations to and now we arrive at one of them we're going back on the outside because you don't hear the hump I don't hear the hump and let's say that where your nose and throat guys and somebody comes to us and says I'm going crazy like I'm seriously contemplating suicide because this home is keeping me up at night I haven't slept at
 hey I'm irritable I have headaches nosebleeds I'm nauseated all the time these are all common symptoms of Home suffers you're going to think one of two things is a a doctor a physician one is tinnitus you're crazy you're driving yourself crazy both of them can kind of be explained away and they are explained by this guy named David Deming and he is a geoscientist from the University of Oklahoma and he wrote what is probably the definitive study on the hum so far back in 2004 that's right so dimming apparently if you look at his research there is another theory and this is where the US government comes into play because there's a couple of
 there's a couple of theories revolving around the US Military and whether or not they are causing this one is with their high frequency active auroral research program H AARP in Alaska and they truly transmit RF signals into the ionosphere and very well we should we go and start talking about the frequency ranges v o f n e l f a v o f is very low frequency and those are waves at one hurts and the other one is he left right
 was there a extremely low frequencies in there in the range of the same amount of hurts but their wavelength is up to like a hundred thousand right extremely long wavelength that's right and people who think you know they call them hum investigators they believe pretty much that it is a vlf in dlf tones that are driving these people crazy and those tones can drive you crazy are they do have adverse effects on the body you know you you probably heard about a lot and when it comes to like cell phone radiation nothing but whether or not he lfn vlf is or are the hum is what's a matter of much debate it is a matter of debate because and it's also kind of a matter of faith
 because what you're talking about there with ALS and BLS frequencies is a tones those are radio waves and radio is part of the electromagnetic spectrum Spectrum right yeah so it has been shown a very very high frequencies humans can detect electromagnetic sound we take it as sound here which is weird cuz it's not supposed to happen like that but that's how we experience it it's not like at a high frequency we suddenly see it we hear it and if you are familiar with the comet 67p that the European Space Agency recently landed on just crazy that comment was found to admit a an electromagnetic clicking sound which is how we experience electromagnets are electromagnetic sound at a certain frequency and so because it's a clicking sound it's not a home at all some people are saying that doesn't make any
 this is a Hammett doesn't if we can hear it it's it's it doesn't sound like a and idling diesel engine it sounds like a clicking sound or something like that and then what's more what this is saying is that if it's a very low frequency or extremely low frequency that's the opposite of how we hear electromagnetic radiation we hired a very high frequency not a very low frequency so what which one is it so yes it's still a huge matter of debate even as to whether the hum first of all if it does exist yeah if it's a single Source single source and then if it is a single Source or any kind of source is it electromagnetic or is it acoustic right and will impact the difference between those things right after this
 Shut Up Fisher
 let's talk about SimpliSafe showy yes they are at home security camera and they are at home security system but actually care about your home and your privacy so they obsess over details and you can tell from the design and how user-friendly their stuff is but they also care about you their customer so they figured out a way to make their camera the security camera in your house private and you can control from your app you can also control the privacy settings and it physically shut the shutter on the camera and it makes a little click sound so you know it's closed and they wanted to have a light on it so you could easily tell when it's on so if you're walking around your home naked as a blue bird you don't have to worry about weirdos eavesdropping on you visually that's right it simply safe is it just home security it's home security done right and right now you can check out Simply Safe today at simplisafe.com stuff that's s i m p l i

 so as to whether or not the hum exist the Canadian government actually part of the problem is it's hard to get research done on this because very small number of people experience it and a lot of them are called crackpots so it's tough to get funding for research but luckily there's a country called Canada that will fun things like this and dr. Colin Novak spent a year listening to The Windsor hum in Ontario and what they found was the hum is real and they trace the source in that case to on the Michigan side of the Detroit River Raceway steel plant on Zug Island and supposedly generates a lot of dlf waves when they're operating so in this instance at least the home was a real thing and they found out it was a tone created from Bass clean industrial plant
 they apparently took steps to cut down on whatever energy I was admitting and they turn off the machine and all of a sudden some people said that worked a lot of people said that did absolutely nothing but I'm still out there and then the most people said I still don't know what you're talking about so that actually the first time government has looked into the hum in Taos New Mexico there's something called the Taos hum and apparently somebody wrote in to complain about it to a local newspaper and all the sudden like hundreds more people said yes I hear the same thing I've been hearing the same thing for years what is going on and enough is enough people said something in New Mexico that it prompted an investigation by the University of New Mexico and Sandia Labs which I think it's like a government Affiliated kind of oil it sit a neat research lab that you all sorts of cool clandestine stuff nitrite
 very much that was mention the hum episode called Drive yeah they talk about it there is a a couple of characters had to constantly move Westward or else they would suffer from the pressure of the home that no one else could hear let me guess Mulder believe Scully did not exactly how did you sell that one but you know so awesome and they could never figure out what it was so I think they kind of wrote it off as either Mass delusion or bunch of people had tinnitus or what-have-you which is again that's the that's the easy that's the easy answer like you have tinnitus the problem is if it's if a person has tinnitus they the sound is internal like remember there's like a bee idea that the get a high-pitch ringing yes usually it can become very in in in Pitch right but for the most part it's in its you can tell it's internal with the hump everyone
 who experiences the hum says no this is external and it's it's there so convinced as external that they'll go out at night when it's worse and try to find the source of it will drive around their city or their neighborhood or walk around and look for what it is it's driving him crazy and they'll never find it turn off the power to their house or I mean there's all sorts of extreme and of course it's all like a anecdotal but people that are driven to Suicide are this one guy who intentionally deaf and himself with a chainsaw and possibly even murder which will get to in a bit interesting but the point is that it's not just something that's just bugging people like it is having the hump their people all over the world that don't know each other that have never met that are suffering from something that they
 there's that other people can't hear in concentrated areas affecting the quality of life and I don't know if I ever finish the sentence which is weird that means I'm really interested in something okay but did we say you're did I say that people who suffer from the hump him to be in their 50s and older that's one of the markers between 50 and 7 okay so there's a this is something in the favor of acoustic sound so Acoustic sound does a compression wave and it's something that carried through and propagates through media so there is a vibration in the air where is an electromagnetic wave comes from an electrical or a magnetic or both Source yeah this is like the vibe vibration it's a sound wave it's it's an acoustic wave right right so as we age so you get to around 50 years of age you your ability to hear
 frequency and mid-frequency Acoustic sound diminishes your low-frequency capabilities go undiminished so it's not like they increase but comparatively speaking right and you get better hearing low frequencies around age 50 interesting so what some people think is that if it is electromagnetic then there are some people out there who are capable of hearing electromagnetic waves while the rest of us can't and they're being driven Crazy by some source that we have yet to identify or if it's acoustic that there are some people out there who are superheroes of low frequency sound which would also kind of do away with another diagnosis that a lot of doctors give people which is hyperacusis which to me is worth a whole other podcast with another people kill themselves over yeah his height and Hyper hearing
 Lowe's is unbearable thing is is if you have hyperacusis it's not just going to be some home that you here and everything else is normal which is what Humsafar his experience you would hear everything on this Grand scale you be like Spider-Man exactly who are predisposed to hearing low frequency sounds way better than other people and that it comes as their higher and mid-frequency capabilities diminish with age right but again what are they hearing well that's right I mention earlier that h a a r p program that the u.s. government military is doing Alaska the other one that I teased is the takamo the take charge and move out system on the 1960s u.s. Navy basically adopted this program to be able to communicate with submarines long-range bombers ballistic missiles during nuclear war and
 use very low frequency radio waves to do so and you know it's a real thing but is it the hum other conspiracy theorist will say that the US government is also using these things to Target individuals and of course that's you know you want to say that's probably bunk but you never know is that if the home is electromagnetic in nature tinfoil hat and aluminum foil hat would actually work is it blocks out about a thin layer of aluminum can block out like 98% of electromagnetic waves so that's pretty ironic that it might actually
 although I don't I haven't heard whether that helps people with the hum if they put on that would help or not her fast if you read David demings Journal article it's called the hump and anomalous sound heard round the world and there is a journal called the Journal of scientific exploration which is a peer-reviewed scientific journal that accepts articles on things on The Fringe of science sure which the most decidedly is David demmin Gets In to talk about when you basically says this is a secret government program so obviously we can't get any real answers we don't know how often it works or how often they're transmitting or anything but we do know it is a real thing and he correlate some dates when there's like upgrades to the system and then all the sudden this one area around the same time there's the Kokomo Indiana hum starts right so he he does a good job of correlating it and I think that's kind of what he settled
 he believes that is probably the taco program that this very low frequency transmission to submarines underwater from airplanes above is being propagated around the world and that would suggest that it's a global Source right that it's just some people can hear these radio waves that you're not supposed to be able to hear ya or its multiple sources combined like a combined effect like if you live near an industrial plant that has a machine that's riding the sound that may be certain people return to or not it's another characteristic is that it's mostly experienced in the country
 cuz he had just chalk that up to noise pollution being revised like when I worked at a convenience store in the midnight shift the when I work during the day I was I would not notice anything but when I worked there at night at 3 a.m. that would hear the buzzing of the fluorescent lights and it would drive me crazy you know I would turn them off and people think we're closed so the thing is you eventually stopped hearing that right when I left work that's called habituation so habituation means that you are capable of so like you'd focus on these things the whole time you were there well yeah in the middle of that wouldn't focus on it but I would notice I'd be reading a book and I would just hear that
 ultrasound but I never noticed it during the day when the lights are on when you didn't hear it that's habituation we're like you're exposed to something your brain says this is totally it's not a threat I don't have to pay attention to it anymore so anytime in this context that I hear that sound I don't have to become cognizant of it no apparently you did you kind of like fell into cognizance like here there in like you'd notice it again but if for a normal human being when you're exposed to something like that over and over again the less you notice it right but like we said with the hum the more you're exposed to the easier it is to TuneIn yeah and what that's called Escape it and no and not only can you not Escape it you can catch it easier and easier like you can become cognizant of it easier and easier the more you're exposed to it that's called sensitization where
 I guess another explanation for the the suffers of the hump they are hearing something one of the reasons that it drives him so bad he is because their habituation levels are low but they're sensitive sensitive Asian levels are high right so they're not able to ignore it and some part of their brain is working in on it and this creates this I guess a perfect storm of hellacious mess
 alright well right after this break I did mention murder so we're going to talk about one of the more interesting parts of the effects of the hump right after this

Org number 3 0 3 0
 alright so I mentioned murder like I said and one of the things that what is the guy's name Steve Cold glaze he's a mechanical engineer and hum investigator in Connecticut and I believe he was the one that traced The Windsor hum to Zug Island and he has done some research that he believes the hum and others believe the hum could be responsible for
 well for killing other people specifically in his case he actually approach Connecticut State Police investigators after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Newtown Connecticut and he said the eye from a nearby gas pipeline might have driven Adam Lanza too well have contributed to driving him to do something like this and I don't think he's saying this made him crazy so he did this I think he's saying the fragile minded people could be pushed over the edge of could be the last straw for somebody and I don't know how much green to ask but investigators did at least include that in the documents they released to the public so they thought it was worthy enough to put in the enemy 7,000 other documents released to the public and he's not the only one I remember the Navy Yard shooting in 2013 Aaron Alexis
 he fully came out and said quote ultra low frequency attack is what I've been subject to for the last 3 years I'm sorry 3 months and to be perfectly honest that is what has driven me to this in quote and he scrawled and scratched e l f on the shotgun barrel that he used to kill 12 people at the Washington Navy yard and he scratched my elf weapon on the stock I think yeah and basically conspiracy theorist what's a while this is clearly driving people to do things like this Skeptics are going to say now these people are delusional and they're the ones who believe the government is shooting them with these POF tones and driving them crazy but either way it's a little startling
 did someone win scratch that in their shotgun before they did something like that and then blame it on that out right but you know how exposed was he to those conspiracy theories like a lot of times I would say well do you know there's a Yahoo group dedicated to the home there's that one world hum map and database in like people who go see these things I mean are they are they just suggestible and they're like yeah I can hear it to David Deming points out like that's crazy that idea that people are tuning into this thing that's having a really diminishing effect on their well-being as part of just a mass delusion or something like that kind of goes against the the typical psychology of master illusion where people join crowds to be added to get some sort of positive benefit or effect from it right there feeling a sense of inclusion or whatever by saying I hear the hum to been in a very small minority but apparently if you are
 Humsafar like your life is screwed up and you're not a happy person yeah I will say this one thing I've noticed about conspiracy theorist is none of them ever believe one thing. They believe a lot of them you know so that's all I have to say about that not only is this driving people crazy there is evidence that if this does exist if there is something that if there's some sort of what's called low frequency noise that's in the environment it is it's everywhere but if people are being exposed to it there's evidence that biologically speaking it can have an impact sure and they're just happened to be this incredible real world laboratory that spring up in Portugal in the late 70s because a guy named castelo Branco was put in charge of the Portuguese Air Force's maintenance repair and Manufacturing
 plant called oh, I don't know Portuguese accent or else I do it happened it just be sitting there and he watched a aircraft technician wander around aimlessly in what apparently looked a lot like an epileptic seizure to this doctor and that it was during an it was called an aircraft run up procedure where they like going through all the systems and this guy was just standing there and all of a sudden he's wandering around so he looked into it and found that 10% of the workers at this aircraft repair shop or diagnosed with the late onset epilepsy and if you looked at the population in compared to the population of Portugal large not you wouldn't expect 10% to have it you'd expect to percentile while to have it now the fact that there are a lot of people who are being diagnosed with this really do believe that they were
 exposed to this low frequency noise at everybody was having it a dangerous effect on them and this one guy who is a worker there. Really interested in all this and he created a living will his name was Philippe Pedro in Philippe Pedro is like you cut me open the moment I die and do an autopsy and they found this guy was messed up like how like his that his aorta his heart was thick and the walls were thicken inexplicably Fried Chicken yet pretty much yeah but no that would be explicable so he was a very healthy person then is what you're apparently what they found doesn't jive with his lifestyle he was he was diagnosed with late onset epilepsy he died at age 58 he had to thicken he had taken heart tissue he had a tumor in his kidney had a tumor in his liver and apparently now thanks to this guy and his autopsy he kind of like laid the groundwork for this investigation into
 frequency noise being dangerous for humans even though we don't feel anything but on a cellular level being exposed to the stuff has these effects so apparently if you have thickening of your heart tissue without any kind of inflammation response that is a classic sign of low frequency noise damage it's what's called vibroacoustic disease which certain people may be susceptible to and others are not in theory it was supposedly anyone exposed to it would be susceptible to it really is some people might actually be able to hear right okay what they're being exposed to you while while most people might not so we're all exposed to it then yeah in this article I can't remember the name of it but it was it was basically an overview of this this some aircraft
 play buy some Portuguese scientists they they said it's almost impossible to get a control group to compare because everybody's exposed to low frequency noise just most of us aren't aware of it yeah it's just everywhere but it's not considered a nuisance except for that two to 11% of 4 people who suffer from hearing right and their accounts differ widely as well so that's it's tough to study and you can't get funding to study because it's fringe science unless you're in Canada so they say turn the fan on at night really make sense if the White Noise app should I sleep there again the awesome article by Jerry Keller yeah life science had a couple good articles and then David Deming
 the home in anomalous sound heard around the world and then if this kind of stuff floats your boat you might want to check out some of our friends sites to there's a great podcast by our friend Roman Mars I'm 99% invisible yeah who would be able to explain a lot of the science behind this kind of thing um no but it's kind of up his alley like the vibroacoustic chardia I can totally see him getting into that I just think if somebody dug that they dig 99percentinvisible agreed definitely have probably had something about the right yeah I found molar and of course you can hang out at how stuff works you can just type the home in I don't think it'll bring up an article but see what happens if we don't have one yet but yeah type home into the search bar and see what comes up it's just a fun game since I said search bar it's time for listener mail
 I need to call this Limousin Ranch hey guys I finally have a story for you after listing for over 5 years I live in super rural South Dakota not just the regular Ol South Dakota right my town is only about 30 200 people and it is a largest down within a hundred-mile radius the main business here is agriculture and ranching and big surprise after I married my plumber husband from St.Louis we move back to my little Hometown 6 years ago where we started a plumbing business he started playing business shortly after moving here we got a call to go to Anderson's limosin Ranch Limousin ranch with no e on the end after driving out to the country and lots of gravel roads later he came up on the ranch you fail to see any limos he said he couldn't figure out where all the limousines were and why there would be a limousine company dealership in the middle of nowhere on an Indian reservation I guess he ask the owners and they explained that they run Limousin cattle on their Ranch which I looked up its
 type of cattle from the limousine region of France they don't look like they're wearing cloaks or anything my brother and I tease them for quite some time on this to get a mental image of the absurdity imagine the bass Prairie of Dances with Wolves are Fargo and then expect to see a limousine dealership out there or just a bunch of limousines is kind of Meandering around a field that sounds like something that would happen in Fargo sure it's very Coen Brothers ask but not Kevin Costner asking no he's pretty self serious yeah he did well yeah back in the day when he was a Bible I watch the preview only for that movie Draft Day that he did recently yeah I can barely make it to the preview preview built it up there like I can't believe he's doing it it's really going to do this and it's about the NFL draft and they finally I was when I was in the movie theater the preview of
 number to my buddy Scottie do you know and I was like what like what does he do does he like open fire on the road like shoot people or is it just some sort of trade I can't believe this is happening did you ever see the movie know what was Scott steak on it he just laughed and said yeah exactly that sounds like a guy that's he's the guy that laughs and things like that is from Jennifer Coleman oh I forgot we were and her husband for that that's pretty funny stuff and he should stick to the plumbing business and yeah for real not the limousine company finding business someone you loved on our show you can't we to us at sysk podcast you can join us on facebook.com stuff you should know you can send this email to stuff podcast that howstuffworks.com you also can do the most

hey everybody it's your old pal Josh and for this week's sys K select I've chosen how the hum Works came out back in December of 2014 and it is probably the saddest most aggravating Affliction I can think of next to Morgan's because people don't believe you when you have this thing it's pretty interesting episode if you ask me it's got everything The X-Files makes an appearance and so does vocal fry before a vocal fry episode ever came out so hope you enjoy it pawn shops
welcome to stuff you should know from how stuff works.com
 hey I'm walking to the podcast on Josh Clark for Charles W Chuck Bryant and I would say it's stuff you should know but it's not because I haven't said Jerry and now I did so this is stuff you should know
 are people going crazy yet but I don't know there's probably some people he started going crazy the moment they hit play Chuck's version of the hum capital T Capital H yeah so the home you just did
 it makes sense it to him but apparently like if you'd listen I don't know I wonder if you can do the same thing I'm hearing because you're hearing it in your head but there's like a Gravely quality to it the vocal fry okay if you want to call it that I say Gravely but it's not it wasn't constant The Gravely can give it texture and it was kind of broken up a little bit that is more then the The Unbroken part that was going through out yeah so apparently while this is called the hum and we should eventually explain what we're talking about it's not the classical definition of a hum that people here right it's not it's it's it's like a diesel truck idling engine idling issues with a classic description of a vocal fry is one of those you ever hear and learn of a new expression or thing in the never heard of and then you see everywhere it's called the baader-meinhof phenomenon and it's happening to me with vocal fry where did you hear that
 I can't remember where they initially heard it but it's a thing now that they say like Kim Kardashian is who they always blame it's in the vocal affectation that supposedly young women are using now where they go into that lower tone that Gravelly tone uncertain at fight the ends of sentences you being promoted at work or something yeah it is the female equivalent of the guys who speak up yeah we're all the old valley girl thing of the witches of speak like the valley girls talking like that but now it's you know he was a nice guy but I really wasn't sure what his motivation was okay yeah that's great the pigtails is now yeah I was talking to me about it the other day she was like do I do that so now you don't do that no you don't I just did that didn't i l a little bit but you you were doing a different voice so it makes sense yeah
 anyway I can't escape it now it's like every other day since I've heard it I've seen something about vocal fry people with vocal fry more all the time okay yeah it's annoying like what you're describing has really nothing to do with the hump but it actually does have a lot in common with the home in that it's driving me to Suicide tend to be able to focus in on it more and more easily the more that they're exposed to it which is the opposite of what should happen to it a noise that really is inconsequential in the environment that's right so what were talking about your Chuck is the hump with a capital H that's right what what is it well it is it is it sound mysterious sound that is heard in places around the world by about 2% of the five local population it is a low freaking we're going to get into the frequencies
 that but let's just got a low-frequency rumbling right now it's a drone it's a vibration describe sometimes as it sounds like it's coming from nowhere or inside my own head and it is there are places all around the world where like I said very small population of people experience this hum and depending on where you are they will name at that time like the Auckland home the Windsor hum the Bristol home via the Taos hum and it's been described you know going back to the 1800's people have talked about it and literature but really in the 1950 60s and 70s in the modern world is when people have started describing hearing this thing that drives them batty basically one of the ways that it drives and baddies Bill say Do you hear that and everyone else in the room will say no the other 98% of people say
 what else in the room goes right maybe a little wacky this General late night it's worse at night for sure and generally and more rural areas yes which makes sense because it's not as much noise pollution I think exactly it also is tends to be worse in doors so at night which is a weird indoors means that you don't get much sleep because it's something that you can't not focus on people who suffer from the hum 10 to say that it dominates the soundscape yeah it's not something they can just tune out right it's not something that they're getting used to and again the more the more they're exposed to it the easier they say it is to tune into it I guess become cognizant of it yet again yeah that's about it yeah and imagine being played by a sound that does this to you and that everyone else says is not real because they don't hear it yeah and it it's been I mean we'll get into the reasons
 are there maybe or may not be happening but it's been pass off as mass hysteria Mass delusion from everything from Matt to like government conspiracy to legitimate illegitimate noise whether or not it's acoustic or electromagnetic and that's part of the problem is is there one hum weather lots of homes is there no harm you know your ears Skeptics will say there is no harm its tinnitus or it's something like that right or some other inner ear annoys like Odell acoustic noise so who knows that the hum okay so again let's let's restate this and let's put ourselves in the position of the outsider okay cuz I don't experience them so I don't either knock on wood because the more I research it some more I'm like oh God I hope I never do we we left out one
 quality of it that is that is common around the world and when we say around the world it tends to be curiously concentrated in the West End in Euro Euro ancestry West yeah I didn't really see anything about any countries in the East if you look at there is a guy who runs a discipline McPherson yes Clan MacPherson run something called the world hum map and database and we ran into Glen McPherson before we get too far we should give a huge shout-out to Jerry Keller over at Mike who wrote this amazing article called The Mysterious sound is driving people insane and nobody knows what's causing it totally worth Reading PA and he talks about a guy named Glenn McPherson who's the professor in British Columbia and he set up a website called the world hum map in database and so anybody who hears the hump can go and fill out a questionnaire and then it takes that
 and put the dot on the map you can hover over the. And get the day that right if you look at it it's just the United States Great Britain Western Europe South Africa's pretty it's it's unusual that there's nothing in Africa except South Africa and it's just in these European ancestry Western countries on the one hand you could say well that's because this is an english-language database and I have no idea what I'm typing here but yeah yeah exactly exclamation exclamations to and now we arrive at one of them we're going back on the outside because you don't hear the hump I don't hear the hump and let's say that where your nose and throat guys and somebody comes to us and says I'm going crazy like I'm seriously contemplating suicide because this home is keeping me up at night I haven't slept at
 hey I'm irritable I have headaches nosebleeds I'm nauseated all the time these are all common symptoms of Home suffers you're going to think one of two things is a a doctor a physician one is tinnitus you're crazy you're driving yourself crazy both of them can kind of be explained away and they are explained by this guy named David Deming and he is a geoscientist from the University of Oklahoma and he wrote what is probably the definitive study on the hum so far back in 2004 that's right so dimming apparently if you look at his research there is another theory and this is where the US government comes into play because there's a couple of
 there's a couple of theories revolving around the US Military and whether or not they are causing this one is with their high frequency active auroral research program H AARP in Alaska and they truly transmit RF signals into the ionosphere and very well we should we go and start talking about the frequency ranges v o f n e l f a v o f is very low frequency and those are waves at one hurts and the other one is he left right
 was there a extremely low frequencies in there in the range of the same amount of hurts but their wavelength is up to like a hundred thousand right extremely long wavelength that's right and people who think you know they call them hum investigators they believe pretty much that it is a vlf in dlf tones that are driving these people crazy and those tones can drive you crazy are they do have adverse effects on the body you know you you probably heard about a lot and when it comes to like cell phone radiation nothing but whether or not he lfn vlf is or are the hum is what's a matter of much debate it is a matter of debate because and it's also kind of a matter of faith
 because what you're talking about there with ALS and BLS frequencies is a tones those are radio waves and radio is part of the electromagnetic spectrum Spectrum right yeah so it has been shown a very very high frequencies humans can detect electromagnetic sound we take it as sound here which is weird cuz it's not supposed to happen like that but that's how we experience it it's not like at a high frequency we suddenly see it we hear it and if you are familiar with the comet 67p that the European Space Agency recently landed on just crazy that comment was found to admit a an electromagnetic clicking sound which is how we experience electromagnets are electromagnetic sound at a certain frequency and so because it's a clicking sound it's not a home at all some people are saying that doesn't make any
 this is a Hammett doesn't if we can hear it it's it's it doesn't sound like a and idling diesel engine it sounds like a clicking sound or something like that and then what's more what this is saying is that if it's a very low frequency or extremely low frequency that's the opposite of how we hear electromagnetic radiation we hired a very high frequency not a very low frequency so what which one is it so yes it's still a huge matter of debate even as to whether the hum first of all if it does exist yeah if it's a single Source single source and then if it is a single Source or any kind of source is it electromagnetic or is it acoustic right and will impact the difference between those things right after this
 Shut Up Fisher
 let's talk about SimpliSafe showy yes they are at home security camera and they are at home security system but actually care about your home and your privacy so they obsess over details and you can tell from the design and how user-friendly their stuff is but they also care about you their customer so they figured out a way to make their camera the security camera in your house private and you can control from your app you can also control the privacy settings and it physically shut the shutter on the camera and it makes a little click sound so you know it's closed and they wanted to have a light on it so you could easily tell when it's on so if you're walking around your home naked as a blue bird you don't have to worry about weirdos eavesdropping on you visually that's right it simply safe is it just home security it's home security done right and right now you can check out Simply Safe today at simplisafe.com stuff that's s i m p l i

 so as to whether or not the hum exist the Canadian government actually part of the problem is it's hard to get research done on this because very small number of people experience it and a lot of them are called crackpots so it's tough to get funding for research but luckily there's a country called Canada that will fun things like this and dr. Colin Novak spent a year listening to The Windsor hum in Ontario and what they found was the hum is real and they trace the source in that case to on the Michigan side of the Detroit River Raceway steel plant on Zug Island and supposedly generates a lot of dlf waves when they're operating so in this instance at least the home was a real thing and they found out it was a tone created from Bass clean industrial plant
 they apparently took steps to cut down on whatever energy I was admitting and they turn off the machine and all of a sudden some people said that worked a lot of people said that did absolutely nothing but I'm still out there and then the most people said I still don't know what you're talking about so that actually the first time government has looked into the hum in Taos New Mexico there's something called the Taos hum and apparently somebody wrote in to complain about it to a local newspaper and all the sudden like hundreds more people said yes I hear the same thing I've been hearing the same thing for years what is going on and enough is enough people said something in New Mexico that it prompted an investigation by the University of New Mexico and Sandia Labs which I think it's like a government Affiliated kind of oil it sit a neat research lab that you all sorts of cool clandestine stuff nitrite
 very much that was mention the hum episode called Drive yeah they talk about it there is a a couple of characters had to constantly move Westward or else they would suffer from the pressure of the home that no one else could hear let me guess Mulder believe Scully did not exactly how did you sell that one but you know so awesome and they could never figure out what it was so I think they kind of wrote it off as either Mass delusion or bunch of people had tinnitus or what-have-you which is again that's the that's the easy that's the easy answer like you have tinnitus the problem is if it's if a person has tinnitus they the sound is internal like remember there's like a bee idea that the get a high-pitch ringing yes usually it can become very in in in Pitch right but for the most part it's in its you can tell it's internal with the hump everyone
 who experiences the hum says no this is external and it's it's there so convinced as external that they'll go out at night when it's worse and try to find the source of it will drive around their city or their neighborhood or walk around and look for what it is it's driving him crazy and they'll never find it turn off the power to their house or I mean there's all sorts of extreme and of course it's all like a anecdotal but people that are driven to Suicide are this one guy who intentionally deaf and himself with a chainsaw and possibly even murder which will get to in a bit interesting but the point is that it's not just something that's just bugging people like it is having the hump their people all over the world that don't know each other that have never met that are suffering from something that they
 there's that other people can't hear in concentrated areas affecting the quality of life and I don't know if I ever finish the sentence which is weird that means I'm really interested in something okay but did we say you're did I say that people who suffer from the hump him to be in their 50s and older that's one of the markers between 50 and 7 okay so there's a this is something in the favor of acoustic sound so Acoustic sound does a compression wave and it's something that carried through and propagates through media so there is a vibration in the air where is an electromagnetic wave comes from an electrical or a magnetic or both Source yeah this is like the vibe vibration it's a sound wave it's it's an acoustic wave right right so as we age so you get to around 50 years of age you your ability to hear
 frequency and mid-frequency Acoustic sound diminishes your low-frequency capabilities go undiminished so it's not like they increase but comparatively speaking right and you get better hearing low frequencies around age 50 interesting so what some people think is that if it is electromagnetic then there are some people out there who are capable of hearing electromagnetic waves while the rest of us can't and they're being driven Crazy by some source that we have yet to identify or if it's acoustic that there are some people out there who are superheroes of low frequency sound which would also kind of do away with another diagnosis that a lot of doctors give people which is hyperacusis which to me is worth a whole other podcast with another people kill themselves over yeah his height and Hyper hearing
 Lowe's is unbearable thing is is if you have hyperacusis it's not just going to be some home that you here and everything else is normal which is what Humsafar his experience you would hear everything on this Grand scale you be like Spider-Man exactly who are predisposed to hearing low frequency sounds way better than other people and that it comes as their higher and mid-frequency capabilities diminish with age right but again what are they hearing well that's right I mention earlier that h a a r p program that the u.s. government military is doing Alaska the other one that I teased is the takamo the take charge and move out system on the 1960s u.s. Navy basically adopted this program to be able to communicate with submarines long-range bombers ballistic missiles during nuclear war and
 use very low frequency radio waves to do so and you know it's a real thing but is it the hum other conspiracy theorist will say that the US government is also using these things to Target individuals and of course that's you know you want to say that's probably bunk but you never know is that if the home is electromagnetic in nature tinfoil hat and aluminum foil hat would actually work is it blocks out about a thin layer of aluminum can block out like 98% of electromagnetic waves so that's pretty ironic that it might actually
 although I don't I haven't heard whether that helps people with the hum if they put on that would help or not her fast if you read David demings Journal article it's called the hump and anomalous sound heard round the world and there is a journal called the Journal of scientific exploration which is a peer-reviewed scientific journal that accepts articles on things on The Fringe of science sure which the most decidedly is David demmin Gets In to talk about when you basically says this is a secret government program so obviously we can't get any real answers we don't know how often it works or how often they're transmitting or anything but we do know it is a real thing and he correlate some dates when there's like upgrades to the system and then all the sudden this one area around the same time there's the Kokomo Indiana hum starts right so he he does a good job of correlating it and I think that's kind of what he settled
 he believes that is probably the taco program that this very low frequency transmission to submarines underwater from airplanes above is being propagated around the world and that would suggest that it's a global Source right that it's just some people can hear these radio waves that you're not supposed to be able to hear ya or its multiple sources combined like a combined effect like if you live near an industrial plant that has a machine that's riding the sound that may be certain people return to or not it's another characteristic is that it's mostly experienced in the country
 cuz he had just chalk that up to noise pollution being revised like when I worked at a convenience store in the midnight shift the when I work during the day I was I would not notice anything but when I worked there at night at 3 a.m. that would hear the buzzing of the fluorescent lights and it would drive me crazy you know I would turn them off and people think we're closed so the thing is you eventually stopped hearing that right when I left work that's called habituation so habituation means that you are capable of so like you'd focus on these things the whole time you were there well yeah in the middle of that wouldn't focus on it but I would notice I'd be reading a book and I would just hear that
 ultrasound but I never noticed it during the day when the lights are on when you didn't hear it that's habituation we're like you're exposed to something your brain says this is totally it's not a threat I don't have to pay attention to it anymore so anytime in this context that I hear that sound I don't have to become cognizant of it no apparently you did you kind of like fell into cognizance like here there in like you'd notice it again but if for a normal human being when you're exposed to something like that over and over again the less you notice it right but like we said with the hum the more you're exposed to the easier it is to TuneIn yeah and what that's called Escape it and no and not only can you not Escape it you can catch it easier and easier like you can become cognizant of it easier and easier the more you're exposed to it that's called sensitization where
 I guess another explanation for the the suffers of the hump they are hearing something one of the reasons that it drives him so bad he is because their habituation levels are low but they're sensitive sensitive Asian levels are high right so they're not able to ignore it and some part of their brain is working in on it and this creates this I guess a perfect storm of hellacious mess
 alright well right after this break I did mention murder so we're going to talk about one of the more interesting parts of the effects of the hump right after this

Org number 3 0 3 0
 alright so I mentioned murder like I said and one of the things that what is the guy's name Steve Cold glaze he's a mechanical engineer and hum investigator in Connecticut and I believe he was the one that traced The Windsor hum to Zug Island and he has done some research that he believes the hum and others believe the hum could be responsible for
 well for killing other people specifically in his case he actually approach Connecticut State Police investigators after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Newtown Connecticut and he said the eye from a nearby gas pipeline might have driven Adam Lanza too well have contributed to driving him to do something like this and I don't think he's saying this made him crazy so he did this I think he's saying the fragile minded people could be pushed over the edge of could be the last straw for somebody and I don't know how much green to ask but investigators did at least include that in the documents they released to the public so they thought it was worthy enough to put in the enemy 7,000 other documents released to the public and he's not the only one I remember the Navy Yard shooting in 2013 Aaron Alexis
 he fully came out and said quote ultra low frequency attack is what I've been subject to for the last 3 years I'm sorry 3 months and to be perfectly honest that is what has driven me to this in quote and he scrawled and scratched e l f on the shotgun barrel that he used to kill 12 people at the Washington Navy yard and he scratched my elf weapon on the stock I think yeah and basically conspiracy theorist what's a while this is clearly driving people to do things like this Skeptics are going to say now these people are delusional and they're the ones who believe the government is shooting them with these POF tones and driving them crazy but either way it's a little startling
 did someone win scratch that in their shotgun before they did something like that and then blame it on that out right but you know how exposed was he to those conspiracy theories like a lot of times I would say well do you know there's a Yahoo group dedicated to the home there's that one world hum map and database in like people who go see these things I mean are they are they just suggestible and they're like yeah I can hear it to David Deming points out like that's crazy that idea that people are tuning into this thing that's having a really diminishing effect on their well-being as part of just a mass delusion or something like that kind of goes against the the typical psychology of master illusion where people join crowds to be added to get some sort of positive benefit or effect from it right there feeling a sense of inclusion or whatever by saying I hear the hum to been in a very small minority but apparently if you are
 Humsafar like your life is screwed up and you're not a happy person yeah I will say this one thing I've noticed about conspiracy theorist is none of them ever believe one thing. They believe a lot of them you know so that's all I have to say about that not only is this driving people crazy there is evidence that if this does exist if there is something that if there's some sort of what's called low frequency noise that's in the environment it is it's everywhere but if people are being exposed to it there's evidence that biologically speaking it can have an impact sure and they're just happened to be this incredible real world laboratory that spring up in Portugal in the late 70s because a guy named castelo Branco was put in charge of the Portuguese Air Force's maintenance repair and Manufacturing
 plant called oh, I don't know Portuguese accent or else I do it happened it just be sitting there and he watched a aircraft technician wander around aimlessly in what apparently looked a lot like an epileptic seizure to this doctor and that it was during an it was called an aircraft run up procedure where they like going through all the systems and this guy was just standing there and all of a sudden he's wandering around so he looked into it and found that 10% of the workers at this aircraft repair shop or diagnosed with the late onset epilepsy and if you looked at the population in compared to the population of Portugal large not you wouldn't expect 10% to have it you'd expect to percentile while to have it now the fact that there are a lot of people who are being diagnosed with this really do believe that they were
 exposed to this low frequency noise at everybody was having it a dangerous effect on them and this one guy who is a worker there. Really interested in all this and he created a living will his name was Philippe Pedro in Philippe Pedro is like you cut me open the moment I die and do an autopsy and they found this guy was messed up like how like his that his aorta his heart was thick and the walls were thicken inexplicably Fried Chicken yet pretty much yeah but no that would be explicable so he was a very healthy person then is what you're apparently what they found doesn't jive with his lifestyle he was he was diagnosed with late onset epilepsy he died at age 58 he had to thicken he had taken heart tissue he had a tumor in his kidney had a tumor in his liver and apparently now thanks to this guy and his autopsy he kind of like laid the groundwork for this investigation into
 frequency noise being dangerous for humans even though we don't feel anything but on a cellular level being exposed to the stuff has these effects so apparently if you have thickening of your heart tissue without any kind of inflammation response that is a classic sign of low frequency noise damage it's what's called vibroacoustic disease which certain people may be susceptible to and others are not in theory it was supposedly anyone exposed to it would be susceptible to it really is some people might actually be able to hear right okay what they're being exposed to you while while most people might not so we're all exposed to it then yeah in this article I can't remember the name of it but it was it was basically an overview of this this some aircraft
 play buy some Portuguese scientists they they said it's almost impossible to get a control group to compare because everybody's exposed to low frequency noise just most of us aren't aware of it yeah it's just everywhere but it's not considered a nuisance except for that two to 11% of 4 people who suffer from hearing right and their accounts differ widely as well so that's it's tough to study and you can't get funding to study because it's fringe science unless you're in Canada so they say turn the fan on at night really make sense if the White Noise app should I sleep there again the awesome article by Jerry Keller yeah life science had a couple good articles and then David Deming
 the home in anomalous sound heard around the world and then if this kind of stuff floats your boat you might want to check out some of our friends sites to there's a great podcast by our friend Roman Mars I'm 99% invisible yeah who would be able to explain a lot of the science behind this kind of thing um no but it's kind of up his alley like the vibroacoustic chardia I can totally see him getting into that I just think if somebody dug that they dig 99percentinvisible agreed definitely have probably had something about the right yeah I found molar and of course you can hang out at how stuff works you can just type the home in I don't think it'll bring up an article but see what happens if we don't have one yet but yeah type home into the search bar and see what comes up it's just a fun game since I said search bar it's time for listener mail
 I need to call this Limousin Ranch hey guys I finally have a story for you after listing for over 5 years I live in super rural South Dakota not just the regular Ol South Dakota right my town is only about 30 200 people and it is a largest down within a hundred-mile radius the main business here is agriculture and ranching and big surprise after I married my plumber husband from St.Louis we move back to my little Hometown 6 years ago where we started a plumbing business he started playing business shortly after moving here we got a call to go to Anderson's limosin Ranch Limousin ranch with no e on the end after driving out to the country and lots of gravel roads later he came up on the ranch you fail to see any limos he said he couldn't figure out where all the limousines were and why there would be a limousine company dealership in the middle of nowhere on an Indian reservation I guess he ask the owners and they explained that they run Limousin cattle on their Ranch which I looked up its
 type of cattle from the limousine region of France they don't look like they're wearing cloaks or anything my brother and I tease them for quite some time on this to get a mental image of the absurdity imagine the bass Prairie of Dances with Wolves are Fargo and then expect to see a limousine dealership out there or just a bunch of limousines is kind of Meandering around a field that sounds like something that would happen in Fargo sure it's very Coen Brothers ask but not Kevin Costner asking no he's pretty self serious yeah he did well yeah back in the day when he was a Bible I watch the preview only for that movie Draft Day that he did recently yeah I can barely make it to the preview preview built it up there like I can't believe he's doing it it's really going to do this and it's about the NFL draft and they finally I was when I was in the movie theater the preview of
 number to my buddy Scottie do you know and I was like what like what does he do does he like open fire on the road like shoot people or is it just some sort of trade I can't believe this is happening did you ever see the movie know what was Scott steak on it he just laughed and said yeah exactly that sounds like a guy that's he's the guy that laughs and things like that is from Jennifer Coleman oh I forgot we were and her husband for that that's pretty funny stuff and he should stick to the plumbing business and yeah for real not the limousine company finding business someone you loved on our show you can't we to us at sysk podcast you can join us on facebook.com stuff you should know you can send this email to stuff podcast that howstuffworks.com you also can do the most
